		Task 5 - csrss.exe
			• Client Server Runtime Process
			• Mission critical
		Task 6 - wininit.exe
			• As it implies, Windows Initialization Process
			• Launches services.exe, lsass.exe & lsaiso.exe
			• Critical
		Task 7 - wininit.exe > services.exe
			• Service Control Manager
			• Queryable via sc.exe
		Task 8 - wininit.exe > services.exe > svchost.exe

			• Process Explorer
				○ Like a better Services app, but laid out more similarly to Task Manager rather than Services
			• ProcMon
				○ Shows realtime file system, registry and process/thread activity
			• PsExec
				○ Basically a remote shell for executing processes on other systems
		Task 7 - Security Utilities

	Windows Event Logs
		Task 1 - What Are Event Logs?
			• Logs of events and activity on the system, good for diagnosing and auditing systems
		Task 2 - Event Viewer
			• Elements of Event Logon
				○ System Logs - OS related events
				○ Security Logs - Tracks log in/log off
				○ Application Logs - Events relating to installed applications
				○ Directory Service Events - AD changes
				○ File Replication Service Events - Sharing of Group Policies and logon scripts shared by DCs
				○ DNS Event Logs - Domain events
				○ Custom Logs
			• A convenient way to read through events on the system, such as the ones above
		Task 3 - wevtutil.exe
			• Powershell tool to retrieve info on events efficiently
		Task 4 - Get-WinEvent
			• Powershell tool to get events and event logs from a pc, remote or local
		Task 5 - XPath Queries

				○ (DEPRECATED) https://static1.squarespace.com/static/552092d5e4b0661088167e5c/t/580595db9f745688bc7477f6/1476761074992/Windows+Logging+Cheat+Sheet_ver_Oct_2016.pdf
				○ (DEPRECATED) https://web.archive.org/web/20190115215749/https://apps.nsa.gov/iaarchive/customcf/openAttachment.cfm?FilePath=/iad/library/ia-guidance/security-configuration/applications/assets/public/upload/Spotting-the-Adversary-with-Windows-Event-Log-Monitoring.pdf&WpKes=aF6woL7fQp3dJiqyJL2LenrLxuHC7ztGtVNK3x
		Task 7 - Putting Theory Into Practice

	--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--

	Sysmon
		Task 1 - Intro
		Task 2 - Sysmon Overview
			• A tool used to monitor and log events on Windows
				○ Essentially a further detailed Event Logs
				○ Persistent across reboots
			Notable Event ID:
				ID 1: Proc Creation
				ID 3: Network Connection
				ID 7: Image Loaded
				ID 8: CreateRemoteThread
				ID 11: File Created
				ID 12/3/4: Registry Event
				ID 15: FileCreateStreamHash
				ID 22: DNS Event
		Task 3 - Installing and Preparing Sysmon
			• After installation via SysInternals, run this powershell/cmd script as admin
				○ Sysmon.exe -accepteula -i ..\Configuration\swift.xml
		Task 4 - Cutting Out the Noise
			• Better to work off a 'Exclude' process than an 'Include' process for rules
			• CLI is more powerful
			• Can do rudementary filtering with Event Viewer
			• Further filtering with PowerShell
		Task 5 - Hunting Metasploit
			• I don't think Metasploit requires any introduction
			• Will focus on detecting meterpreter
				○ Suspicious ports (4444, 5555, etc)
			• Can do this hunting with 
		Task 6 - Detecting Mimikatz
			• Mimikatz is a credential dumper and post-exploitation tool
			• Can detect file creation named 'mimikatz'
			• Look for LSASS.exe abuse and abnormal behavior
		Task 7 - Hunting Malware
			• Look for ports known to be used by malware (1034, 1604 for Ion-Storm) while using the exclude rule for goodware
			• EXAMPLE:
			/	<RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
			|		<NetworkConnect onmatch="include">
			|			<DestinationPort condition="is">1034</DestinationPort>
			|			<DestinationPort condition="is">1604</DestinationPort>
			|		</NetworkConnect>
			|		<NetworkConnect onmatch="exclude">
			|			<Image condition="image">OneDrive.exe</Image>
			|		</NetworkConnect>
			\	</RuleGroup>
		Task 8 - Hunting Persistence
			• Look for files placed in \Startup or \Start Menu directories
			• Look for regedits allowing for persistence
				○ Placing script in CurrentVersion\Windows\Run
		Task 9 - Detecting Evasion Techniques
			• Using ADS to avoid detection
			• Another one is to use remote threads

	OSQuery
		Task 1 - Intro
			• Open-source agent created by none other than Facebook, it converts the OS to a relational database
				○ Pretty sure they use SQL with their db's so that makes sense lol
			• Makes it easy to query processes, accounts, etc
		Task 2 - Connect with the Lab
			• type osqueryi in powershell to get an interactive mode
		Task 3 - Osquery: Interactive Mode
			• Uses fairly similar syntax to straight up SQL, type .help for help
		Task 4 - Schema Documentation
			• https://osquery.io/schema/5.5.1/
		Task 5 - Creating SQL queries
			• Uses a superset of SQLite
			• Realistically only uses SELECT statement (sometimes UPDATE/DELETE)
			• https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/sql/

		Task 6 - Conclusion

	--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--

	Splunk 2
		Task 1 - Deploy!
		Task 2 - Dive into the data
			• Using teh BOTSv2 dataset
		Task 3 - 100
			• Find her IP with pan:traffic query
			• Use that to query her http stream
				○ Narrow search to only include the site field
			• Some of this data is encoded with base64
		Task 4 - 200
			• She used Tor, so modify the query to find entries pertaining to tor
			• Next I need to ident who's doing a vuln scan on the website, fairly easy with knowing the site's IP
			• With that I can query all actions by the attacker
				○ There's 18k entries, I ident the URI path and rerun the query with that
			• I then do a query to ident a XSS payload relating to Kevin's HTTP traffic
		Task 5 - 300
			• I find Mallorie's hostname then search again for powerpoint files since that was known to be encrypted
			• Next is finding an encrypted Game of Thrones file, I query specifically for "GoT" and get S7E2 (why couldn't it have been a good season :<)
			• Next is about finding a USB drive plugged into a computer named kutekitten, I just use a query for both of those fields
			• I find the malware and enter into VirusTotal for the rest of the information
		Task 6 - 400
			• I'm informed of some TTPs of an APT, specifically using zip files to spear phish victims, a query for smtp and zip is necessary
			• Next I need their SSL Issuer, I search their IP with a SSL keyword
			• I'm told winsys32.dll caused a sus file to be downloaded, I follow the breadcrumbs to find a file with chinese chars
			• I use Joe Sandbox to anaylze the .zip file now that I have it
			• Lastly I saw they found a way to maintain persistence to their C2 server, my first stop was checking schtasks.exe as that's a common way

	Attacktive Directory
	Attacking Kerberos
		I'll be completely honest, I don't think this can fit well within the timeframe necessary and that's on me, I'll be doing this exercise
		after the deadline just for my own personal practice, but I felt it useful to focus on informational labs over CTFs and attack emulations
